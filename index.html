	<h3>About Me</h3>
	I'm a Physics Msc degree student enrolled in the University of Coimbra. I'm pationate about understanding the fundamental laws that govern our universe or the models that we can devise to describe it. I find it fascinating how it is possible for us to create mathematical and physical models that represent a variety of systems at different scales. In physics, I found a special interest in optics, quantum physics, condensed matter physics and statistical physics. My goal is to expand my knowledge on these topics and learn mathematical tools that will allow me to study a variety of systems, in particular,  biological ones.
</p>
As a hobby, I enjoy solving programming puzzles while learning and implementing algorithms. In the future, I hope to marry my interests in programming, biology and physics to create and implement mathematical models of biological systems.

  Summer School in Computational Biology @ University of Coimbra (September 2023)
</h4>
<ul>
  <a href="https://www.uc.pt/events/computationalbiology/" target="_blank">https://www.uc.pt/events/computationalbiology/</a></p>
<text> During this summer school I had the oportunity to expand my knowledge of Molecular and Cell Biology, Genetics, Data Science applied to Biology and Computational Modelling of Biological Systems. I also attended seminars given by experts in the area and worked on an active research project. The detailed class schedule is present in the link above.</p>

For my project I worked under Rui Travasso's guidance and aimed to replicate and expand on the work done on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-648X/ab7c17" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-648X/ab7c17</a>. Using the Phase-Field Model, I modeled and studied cell migration through an Extra-Cellular Matrix (ECM). The whole project was coded in C++.

  ISEC International Science Engagement Challenge - Philosophy Project (August 2021)
</h4>
<ul>
  <a href="https://summeratisec.org" target="_blank">https://summeratisec.org</a>
During this summer camp I had the task of reflecting about Science, in particular:
what constitutes Science, the Scientific Method, what is Truth and its achievability,
what characterizes a practitioner of Science and the social aspects of Science. </p>
For this goal, I read the works of Peter Kosso, Noam Chomsky, Michel Foucault and
read analyses on Plato’s "The Republic" in order to develop my own opinion on the
topic. In collaboration with a partner and a mentor a final report and presentation
were delivered on the topic.

  ISEC International Science Engagement Challenge - Computer Simulation (July 2020)

On this two week long camp I was assigned the project of simulating the COVID-19
outbreak in Italy with a Brownian Motion model I developed using Python. My goal
was to regard individuals as particles traveling randomly through space and designing
parameters that would allow me to fit the simulation to the known data. I worked
together with a partner and two mentors. The final results were presented in form of
an article and an oral presentation.

      <li>Science Communication Workshops</li>
      <li>Project "Finding the best way to model stellar activity noise with the hydrogen line"</li>

	On this two week project, my partner and I worked on the analysis of the stellar activity of low temperature stars. We obtained results that are new to the literature and may help researchers in the future to better rely on the Radial Velocity Method as a diagnosis tool for the detection of exoplanets orbiting FGK stars. </p>
After the internship I continued to work with my partner and advisers to expand the
study to a larger data set and the findings have been published in <i>Astronomy and Astrophysics</i>.

Member of PhysikUP - Student Nucleus of Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy of FCUP (2020 - 2022)
  </h4>
    <ul>
	      During the first three years of my course, I was part of this organization. Firstly, I was part of the Inreach Department, where my job was to server as a bridge between the students and the professors and researchers of the Physics and Astronomy Department. I helped organize lectures and other activities that aimed at introducing the student body to the research being developed in the different institutes of the faculty. I later became coordinator of the department, where I had the increased responsability of managing other members.</p>
During my last year, I became Vice-President and was in charge of directing the communication between the different departments integrated in the organization. I also had the task of communicating with the student association and other nucleus while addressing general issues or organizing events at a larger scale. My years in these functions served to develop my organizational and leadership skills.
