      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I'm a Physics MSc student enrolled in the University of Coimbra. I'm pationate about understanding the
        fundamental
        laws that govern our universe and the models that we can devise to describe it. I find it fascinating how it is
        possible for us to create mathematical and physical models that represent a variety of systems at disctinct
        scales
        and with different levels of abstraction. Within my area of study, I found a special interest in quantum,
        condensed matter and statistical physics as well as optics. My goal is to expand my knowledge on these topics
        and
        learn mathematical tools that will allow me to study a variety of systems, in particular, biological ones.
      </p>
      <p>As a hobby, I enjoy solving programming puzzles while learning and implementing algorithms. In the future, I
        hope
        to marry my interests in programming, biology and physics to create and implement mathematical models of
        biological systems.</p>

            Genetics,
            Data Science applied to Biology and Computational Modelling of Biological Systems. I also attended seminars
            given by experts in the area and worked on an active research project. The detailed class schedule is

            institute at that time. The organisers took the participants through a virtual tour of the facilities and
            presented us with their active research projects, letting us in on the experience of working in an

            During this summer camp I had the task of reflecting about Science, in particular:
            what constitutes Science, the Scientific Method, what is Truth and its achievability,
            what characterizes a practitioner of Science and the social aspects of Science. </p>
          <p>
            For this goal, I read the works of Peter Kosso, Noam Chomsky, Michel Foucault and
            read analyses on Plato’s "The Republic" in order to develop my own opinion on the
            topic. In collaboration with a partner and a mentor a final report and presentation
            were delivered on the topic.

            On this two week long camp I was assigned the project of simulating the COVID-19
            outbreak in Italy with a Brownian Motion model I developed using Python. My goal
            was to regard individuals as particles traveling randomly through space and designing
            parameters that would allow me to fit the simulation to the known data. I worked
            together with a partner and two mentors. The final results were presented in form of
            an article and an oral presentation.

              communication
              between the
              different departments integrated in the organisation. I also had the task of communicating
              with the
              student
              association and other nucleus while addressing general issues or organising events at a
              larger
              scale. My years
              in these functions served to develop my organisational and leadership skills.
